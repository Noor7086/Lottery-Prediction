# LOTTERY VIDEO BACKGROUND PLACEHOLDER
# 
# This file should be replaced with an actual MP4 video file.
# 
# Current Status: Using CSS fallback animations
# 
# To add a real lottery video:
# 1. Find a lottery-themed video (see README.md in this folder)
# 2. Rename it to "hero-background.mp4"
# 3. Replace this file
# 
# The component will automatically detect and use the video,
# or fall back to CSS animations if no video is available.
